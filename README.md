# Local Environment Setup

Follow the instructions below to set up your laptop for work in this program. If you've previously set up a development environment on your computer, you may choose to skip some steps. However, please consult with a consultant before doing so.

If you are uncertain about any step or need assistance, don't hesitate to ask a consultant. It's important to follow these steps in order. When executing a command, if you don't see any output, it means the command has successfully executed. No output is good news. If you encounter unexpected output in your terminal, please inform a consultant.

**The purpose of this setup is not for you to fully comprehend everything that is being installed or the functionality of each tool!** Your focus should be on following the instructions and completing the tasks. If you have any specific questions about the process, feel free to ask after the completion of the Installfest.
